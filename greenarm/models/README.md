## STORN: optimizations

* Add more layers for feature extraction - done

* Check out the merge with masking pull request @brandnerb
* Consider a Gaussian mixture model @taimir
* Consider trending priors @durner
* Improve training and try to escape local minima
* Grid search for all of the hyper-parameters
* feature extraction of the generative input : try to do it separately for z and x_tm1
